## See what data is available in the model

The subtext of the report title shows the range of the data available in the Power BI Model. Activity data runs from 01/05/21 to the most recent synchronisation, and Cost data covers the full time span of the projects displayed up to the most recent synchronisation. 

These dates will alter depending on the selected project and their underlying data.
