### My desktop won't start

![cannot_start_desktop.png](../../images/troubleshoot/cannot_start_desktop.png)

Chances are good that another member of your team is currently logged in to that specific virtual machine. Try another VM if there is one available within the VRE, or check that no-one else is currently logged in.

A VM will remain 'occupied' even if the user has disconnected. 

Simply closing the window ('Xing out') will disconnect the user from the session. When disconnected the session remains active and running; users will need to log off or shut down to vacate the machine so that someone else can log on.

### I cannot see R: drive

You may need to manually map the R: drive to your machine.
- Open File Explorer and right click on Network  
	![network_context_menu.png](../../images/troubleshoot/network_context_menu.png)
- Select 'Map network drive'
- Drive = R: 
- Folder = \\\azlrdprepos.file.core.windows.net\r-repo
	![map_r_drive.png](../../images/troubleshoot/map_r_drive.png)
- Click finish 

You should now see the R miniCRAN repository mapped to R: drive.

### Anaconda Navigator slow (in online mode)

Anaconda Navigator may be slow to load initially. Follow steps in our [Python guide](./using_python.html#anaconda-navigator-offline-mode) to enable offline mode, which will improve performance.

### I'm seeing a message saying "You cannot log on using a smart card"

If you try to log on to LASER at laser.leeds.ac.uk on a Google Chrome browser, you **may** see the following message:
<br>
    ![cannot_connect_using_smart_card.png](../../images/troubleshoot/cannot_connect_using_smart_card.png)
<br>
This problem can be solved by logging in via a "New incognito window", which can be opened by pressing Ctrl + Shift + n in a Chrome browser or 
- Click on the three vertical dots at the top right of the browser window
- Click on New incognito window
