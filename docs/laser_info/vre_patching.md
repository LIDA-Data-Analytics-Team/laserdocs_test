## VRE Patching Schedule

Security patches are released on the 2nd Tuesday of each month.

VMs have two weeks to install the patches. Once installed a reboot is required. 

If two weeks elapse before installation & reboot a forced install & reboot occurs. This will interrupt any ongoing processes.

Any VMs not turned on at the deadline will install any missing patches that have expired deadlines when turned on again and reboot quickly after install.

If security releases happen outside these dates, these will also have a 14 day deadline. 
We will notify all users via the LIDA Teams General channel.
