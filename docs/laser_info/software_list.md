## Software provision

Some software, such as MS Office, will be installed as standard on all virtual machines (VMs) inside your Virtual Research Environment (VRE). But most software will be made available via Software Center for you to install yourself. For details on how to install software via Software Center and how to request new software, see our [Install Software page](./install_software.html).
