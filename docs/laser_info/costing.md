# The Cost of Using LASER TREs

The TRE cost estimate is influenced by the following factors:

- **Project Duration:** The total duration of the project.
- **Type and Size of Virtual Machine:** The specifications of the Virtual Machine used for the project.
- **Size of Shared Storage and Duration of Archive Storage:** The amount of shared storage used during the project and the duration of archive storage.
- **Presence or Absence of Azure SQL Databases:** Whether Azure SQL Databases are utilized in the project.
- **Azure AI Services:** The usage of Azure AI services.

The Azure costing is on a 'Pay as you go' basis, allowing users to pay for compute capacity by the second, enabling flexibility in usage on demand.

Cost estimates are primarily derived from the Azure pricing calculator. VM usage costs are calculated monthly in hours, with 100% usage equating to 730 hours per month.

Typically, a usage rate of 104 hours per month is estimated, equivalent to 14% usage or approximately 3 days per week (13 days per month, 8 hours per day, from 9 am – 5 pm). This usage rate can be adjusted to meet the needs of users.

The table below illustrates how various factors affect the annual cost of a TRE:
