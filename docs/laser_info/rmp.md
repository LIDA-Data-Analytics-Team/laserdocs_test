# LIDA Research Management Process

When you, as a researcher, approach LIDA with a project proposal, it goes through a 6-stage Research Management Process (RMP). This process guides the project from proposal to completion, including securing funding, approvals, conducting research, and properly closing the project with data handling measures.

## RMP Stages:

1. **Proposal:**
   - Contact Paul Evans, LIDA Research and Innovation Development Manager, with your research proposal.
   - If aligned with LIDA's portfolio, the Data Analytics Team (DAT) will arrange an introductory meeting.

2. **Pre-grant:**
   - DAT provides a project proposal form and guidance.
   - Capture data classification, regulatory compliance, computational resources, and collaboration plans.
   - If using LASER, DAT will estimate costs for inclusion in your grant proposal.

3. **Pre-approval:**
   - After submitting the grant application, the project is in the Pre-approval stage.
   - Contact DAT for queries and to move the project to the Setup stage upon successful funding.

4. **Setup:**
   - DAT guides in providing a Data Management Plan, ethical approval, Data Sharing Agreements, and Data Protection Impact Assessment.
   - Risk assessment and IT Assurance review.
   - If LASER is used, DAT facilitates VRE setup, user agreements, security training, and data preparation.

5. **Active:**
   - Conduct project research.
   - Receive ongoing training and support from DAT.
   - DAT assists in data transfer, destruction, analytics, and technical support.

6. **Close:**
   - Prior to the project end date, DAT requests a status update.
   - For LASER projects, choose to destroy or extend the VRE.
   - If destroying, arrange for data extraction, complete a VRE destruction request, and confirm destruction with DAT.
   - If extending, the project returns to the Proposal stage.
